# Mario Golf (Game Boy Color) — Reverse Engineering Notes

## Binary Identification

From `python3 tools/header.py` (all values checked against the dump; they agree with Data Crystal's USA column).

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| File | `rom/mario_golf.gbc` (dump name `Mario Golf (USA).gbc`) |
| SHA-1 | `7f2062e51b4fc87378c1d5e6b9578c9277b94e0b` |
| MD5 | `83f791645ce282093a9d59c121ffc49d` |
| Size | 2 097 152 bytes = 128 banks of 16 KiB |
| Title / maker code | `MARIO GOLF` + `$00`, manufacturer code `AWXE` ($013F) |
| CGB flag ($0143) | `$C0`: CGB only |
| Licensee | new `01`, old `$33` (Nintendo) |
| SGB flag | `$00` (none) |
| Cartridge ($0147) | `$1B` MBC5 + RAM + battery |
| ROM size ($0148) | `$06` = 2 MiB |
| RAM size ($0149) | `$02` = 8 KiB SRAM (Tennis: `$03`, 32 KiB) |

## Memory Map

Standard Game Boy Color map. Project-specific uses so far:

| Address Range | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| 0000-3FFF | ROM bank 0 (home). Used up to `$3100`; the rest is `$FF`. |
| 4000-7FFF | switchable ROM bank (MBC5, shadow in `hROMBank` = `$FF95`) |
| 8000-9FFF | VRAM, 2 banks |
| A000-BFFF | 8 KiB battery SRAM (enabled through `MBC5_RAMG`; Start writes `$00` = disabled) |
| C000-CFFF | WRAM bank 0. SoftReset clears `C000-CFEF` (ClearMemory16, `c = $FF` x 16 bytes); the stack starts at `$D000` and grows down into it. |
| D000-DFFF | WRAM banks 1-7 (shadow in `hWRAMBank` = `$FF96`); GameMain clears all seven (ClearMemory16 with `c = 0` = 4 KiB each). |
| FF80-FFFE | HRAM. `$FF80-$FFEF` cleared by Start; the OAM DMA routine is copied there (CopyOAMDMARoutineToHRAM, 00:066C). |

## Key Findings

### Architecture

#### Vectors (tools/disasm.py 0 0000)

| Vector | Target | Meaning (shown by reading the target) |
|--------|--------|------------------------------------|
| `rst $00` | 00:0690 JumpTableDispatch | `add a ; pop hl ; ... jp hl`: A-indexed `dw` jump table inline after the `rst` |
| `rst $08` | 00:2BBB PlaySoundCmd | reads 1 inline byte (sound id) and returns past it; ids $36-$3F are jingles (Tennis: $40-$4F) |
| `rst $10` | 00:01F6 FarCallVectorInline | reads inline `db idx, bank`, switches bank, jumps to word `[bank:$4000+idx]`, restores the bank, returns past the 2 bytes |
| `rst $18` | 00:01B6 FarCall | same inline `db idx, bank` far call; keeps a/hl (code identical to Tennis 00:01B6) |
| `rst $20` | 00:2D86 SetGameFlagCmd | inline `dw` flag argument (via FetchInlineWordOperand 00:2D65) |
| `rst $28` | 00:2D93 ClearGameFlagCmd | inline `dw` |
| `rst $30` | 00:2D79 TestGameFlagCmd | inline `dw` |
| `rst $38` | — | no handler (`$FF` fill; executing `$FF` would loop) |
| VBlank | 00:2EF9 | |
| LCD STAT | 00:2F81 | `reti` only |
| Timer | 00:2F6F | farcalls 7E:40EB (sound update) while the LCD is off |
| Serial | 00:2F93 | link-cable byte protocol (`$70`/`$71` handshake bytes) |
| Joypad | 00:0060 | `reti` |

So the Tennis conventions hold, with one difference: Golf's vector table has `rst $10` as a second far call
(Tennis's `$0010` holds data; its `call $01F6` form is replaced here by `rst $10`). Golf uses `rst $10` in
Start and the interrupt handlers; `tools/farcall_stats.py` finds only 87 byte-pattern hits for it, at the level
of chance (the `rst $20` baseline gets 222), so it is rare. `rst $18` has 8067 pattern hits, ~36x the
baseline: it is the normal far call.

#### Start-up (00:2DA0 Start, 00:2DAA SoftReset)

1. `A == $11` from the boot ROM -> `hIsCGB` (`$FFFE`) = 1.
2. SoftReset: `sp = $D000`, DisableLCDSafely, clear `C000-CFEF`, clear HRAM `$FF80-$FFEF`, zero IF/IE/SCY/SCX/STAT.
3. If not CGB: farcall 01:5278 (`rst $10 ; db $02, $01`), presumably the "CGB only" screen.
4. VBK/SVBK/RP = 0, SRAM disabled, OAM DMA routine to HRAM, ClearVRAMBank, SwitchCPUSpeed (double speed),
   `hFFA6 = 6`, 00:2683, ClearFrameTasks, 00:0458, farcall 7E:4072 (sound init).
5. WX = 7, WY = $90, TMA = $77, TAC = `$04` (timer on), STAT = `$08` (HBlank int source), LYC = $50, serial
   set up, IE = `$0D` (VBlank + Timer + Serial), LCDC = `$E7`, `ei`.
6. farcall 01:400E GameMain (`rst $10 ; db $00, $01`), which never returns (a `stop` follows).

GameMain (01:400E) starts by calling 00:304D, DisableLCDSafely, then clears WRAM banks 1-7 through `hWRAMBank`.

#### Frame sync (00:2E3B AdvanceFrame)

Same structure as Tennis's AdvanceFrame (00:2631; the first 12 instructions match): saves registers; if
`hFFC8` is set and `hFFC3 & $E0` (a button combination) jumps to 00:2F8D, which farcalls 08:555F and restarts
at SoftReset; a debug slow-motion/frame-step block driven by `hFF9E`/`hFF9A` and the joypad bytes at
`$FF90/91/94`; then `halt` until `hVBlankDone` (`$FF8D`), runs 00:2688 and RunFrameTasks (00:247D), clears
the flag and increments `wFrameCounter` (`$C4B2`). WaitFrames (00:2EF0) calls it C times; WaitFramesCmd
(00:2ED5) takes C as an inline byte after the `call`.

#### Home bank vs Mario Tennis (tools/compare_home.py)

The Tennis ROM is not needed for this: the tool reads Tennis's bank 0 from the vendored disassembly
(`../mario-tennis-gbc/third_party/mario-tennis-gbc-disasm`, the files its `main.asm` puts in ROM0), reduces both
sides to instruction shapes (registers and conditions kept, numbers and symbols replaced) and finds, for each
Tennis routine of 6+ instructions, the Golf offset that agrees for longest.

Result: of 238 Tennis home routines, **114 match in full** and 14 more match for at least half their length.
`--labels` turned the full matches into 108 labels (marked `(as in Mario Tennis 00:XXXX)`); two Golf addresses
were claimed by twin Tennis routines that differ only in their callees:

- 00:0B3C: MulHLBySin or MulHLBySinSigned. Resolved to MulHLBySin, since its callee 00:0B4C matches
  MulHLBySinHalf in full.
- 00:11CB: MulSin or DivBySin. Unresolved: its callee 00:11DB matches neither MulSinUnsigned nor DivBySinUnsigned.

Layout of Golf's bank 0, in Tennis's order with shifted addresses:

| Golf range | Contents (Tennis names) | Shift vs Tennis |
|------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| 015E-0340 | bank-switch call helpers, FarCall, CopyDataFromBank, DecompressDataFromBank, VRAM clear, OBJ palettes, SwitchCPUSpeed | 0 (same addresses) |
| 0341-0690 | LCD on/off, memory clear/copy, VRAM copy queues (changed), palettes, Far* readers, OAM DMA | -5 to -0x40 |
| 0690-0880 | JumpTableDispatch (different code), indexed far helpers, 32->64 map copies | -0x30 to -0x68 |
| 08B9-1C00 | multiply/divide, random seed, sine/trig, AngleFromVector16 | about -0x6D to +0x5ED (Golf has extra code in this area; DivAHLByDE* do not match) |
| 1F2F-2035 | LZDecompress: different code, same format as Tennis 00:1797 | |
| 203E-2400 | debug overlay/text printing, decimal/hex formatting | +0x7AB |
| 23B6-24EA | frame task list | +0x87E |
| 24EB-2660 | colour components, fades | +0x881 |
| 27B4-2B00 | sprite world positioning, BG blit queue, 64-wide map blits | about +0x850 to +0x7D0 |
| 2B31-2C60 | sound command layer (PlaySoundCmd and BGM helpers); farcalls into bank 7E | |
| 2C6B-2D10 | game timer | +0x88E |
| 2D65-2DA0 | FetchInlineWordOperand, flag commands | +0x828 |
| 2DA0-2F92 | Start, SoftReset, AdvanceFrame, WaitFrames, interrupt handlers | |
| 2F93-3100 | serial link | |

Not in Golf's bank 0 (no match at all): Tennis's sound engine (00:2F1A-3DFF: PlaySound, UpdateSoundChannels,
RunSoundChannelScript, ...), the game-flag routines by byte/number (00:249F-2523), SortFrameTasks, the text
window drawing and 3D view projection helpers (00:2A2E-2F0C), the QueueSprite* family. The sound engine is
farcalled in bank 7E (7E:4016 from PlaySoundCmd, 7E:4072 from Start, 7E:40EB from TimerHandler).

#### LZ compression (00:1F2F LZDecompress; tools/decompress.py)

Read from the code: the same format as Tennis. A control byte gives 8 flags, LSB first: 1 = literal byte,
0 = back-reference `lo, hi`. `lo = hi = 0` ends the stream. Displacement `((hi >> 5) << 8 | lo) - $800`
(the code builds `h = (hi >> 5) | $F8`), length `(hi & $1F) + 3`. The routine is unrolled (control `$FF` copies
8 literals at once; `c` holds the inverted remaining flags plus a sentinel bit). It returns hl = bytes written.
DecompressDataFromBank (00:0234) calls it with hl = `[bank:$4000 + l]`.

Checked on data: `tools/decompress.py` on the bank 28 table gives 28:452F -> 4096 bytes, 28:478D -> 4096,
28:4924 / 28:499B -> 1024, 28:4A13 -> 2048 (whole tile blocks, each stream ending on its end marker). Other
entries in the same table (28:4068, 28:4A99: 3-byte streams to 0 bytes; and some that fail) are not LZ
streams, so each table mixes compressed and raw entries.

#### Bank map (first pass; tools/scan_jumptables.py, tools/bank_map.py)

`bank_map.py` columns: `$4000` table entries, entries that LZ-decompress cleanly, `rst $18` call sites into the
bank. Assets are LZ: banks 28-2F, 40, 4B-4E, 72-74 have 12-37 clean LZ entries each.

| Banks | Evidence | Likely role |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 01 | 7-entry table; GameMain 01:400E | boot / top level |
| 02, 05, 0A, 0B, 10 | most far-call targets (0A: ~5150 call sites, 10: ~880, 05: ~560, 02: ~370, 0B: ~220) | engine libraries |
| 28-2F, 72-74 | 22-52 entries, ~60% LZ | compressed graphics |
| 30-35 | 900-1400 `rst $18` call sites each, mostly into 0A | script-like code (story / RPG mode?) |
| 7C-7E | 11-entry tables at the same layout | sound engine and its data (7E called from bank 0) |
| 18-1F, 44, 46 | 2-entry "tables" whose first word is far from `$4000` | probably no table (heuristic false positive) |
| 27, 47 | no table; 27 is all `$FF` | empty / data |

These roles are guesses from counts only; they are listed so they can be checked.

## Next Tasks

### RE Investigation

- [x] Ph1: identify binary header and platform (header.py; SHA-1 recorded)
- [x] Ph1: RST and interrupt vectors, entry point, Start / SoftReset / AdvanceFrame
- [x] Ph1: bank 0 comparison with Mario Tennis (compare_home.py, 108 labels)
- [x] Ph1: confirm LZ format (LZDecompress 00:1F2F = Tennis format)
- [ ] Teach `disasm.py` the bank-0 table: list `$4000` table entries as `dw` when disassembling a bank from `$4000`
- [ ] Make `scan_jumptables.table()` reject 2-entry false positives (banks 18-1F, 44, 46): require the first
      target at or near the end of the table, or a far-call into the bank
- [ ] Resolve 00:11CB (MulSin vs DivBySin) by reading 00:11DB
- [ ] Read the 14 partial matches (ReadJoypad 02EB, ProcessVRAMCopyQueues 04DE, SoftReset, AdvanceFrame,
      VBlankHandler 2EF9, ...) and name them from the code
- [ ] Name the unmatched bank-0 code: 00:0458, 00:2683/2688, 00:304D, the VBlank handler, the serial protocol
- [ ] GameMain 01:400E: follow it to the scene / mode dispatcher
- [ ] Bank 7E: confirm the sound engine (entries 7E:4016/4072/40EB) and the sound id tables
- [ ] Text: find the font and the text banks (Tennis is ASCII; check `strings_dump.py`)
- [ ] Decompress and render a few LZ entries from banks 28-2F (needs a tile renderer copied from Tennis)
- [ ] Milestone 3: run the game on `web/js/gb` (copy from Tennis) with SRAM saving; `core_vs_pyboy.mjs`

### Web Port Fixes

### Documentation

- [ ] `docs/architecture_exe.md` once the main loop and bank roles are confirmed
